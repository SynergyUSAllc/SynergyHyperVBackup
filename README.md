"How to backup your Hyper-V server for free")



Segment/Isolate your backups media from Malware.

Force disks to offline after backups.

Become invisible from Ransomware/Viruses/Malware or Malicious Acts.

Combine Microsoft’s free Hypervisor Hyper-V Server with our Community version for a 100% free solution.

VMs are replicated so it’s easy to recover after an incident.

Runs both on Hyper-V Core (Hypervisor Command Line Version) and Windows GUI versions.



**THE SOLUTION**

We decided to take an alternative approach.
Our backup software operates independently from the data servers, without utilizing an agent, and functions autonomously on the host while remaining separate from the servers.

Synergy HyperV Backup is a backup application with some unique features:

🛡️ No Agent Required: Synergy HyperV Backup operates directly on HyperV, eliminating the need for an agent to connect to your server. This ensures that your backups are completely segmented, separated, and isolated from your VM servers, making them inaccessible to malware.

💽 Offline Disks: Back up your data to a disk and set it to offline mode, ensuring that malware cannot access or infect it.

🖥️ In-HyperV GUI: Enjoy the convenience of a user-friendly graphical interface within HyperV, making it easier to manage your backups.

🎛️ Centralized Task Management: Perform all necessary tasks directly from within HyperV for a streamlined backup experience.

📑 Multiple Profiles: Manage multiple profiles for your VM backups using a single form, simplifying the backup process.

📅 Intuitive Scheduling: Effortlessly create backup schedules within the application, eliminating the need for command line input.

🔄 Version Compatibility: Synergy HyperV Backup is compatible with 2012, 2012R2, 2016, 2019, and 2022 versions.

🌐 Online Backups: Take backups without stopping or pausing your VMs, ensuring seamless operation.

🗄️ Retention Versions: Maintain up to 9 retention versions of each backup for added security.

🔒 Automatic Offline Backup: Benefit from an automatic offline backup after the completion of your first backup.

☁️ Amazon S3 Integration: Upload your backups to an Amazon S3 bucket for additional storage and protection.

📜 Script Command Execution: Execute script commands before and after your backup execution for customized backup processes.

📧 Email Notifications: Receive email notifications after the execution of each backup to stay informed and updated.

All above features guarantee that your backup data remains undetectable, even when faced with potential infections or other failures.


**WHO NEEDS IT**

IT and MSP companies, system administrators, network administrators, security administrators, and other power users can greatly benefit from incorporating an additional layer of security to protect their systems from potential hackers. 

By implementing robust security measures, these professionals can safeguard critical data and network infrastructure, ensuring the continuity and stability of their operations. 

This extra layer of protection is essential in today’s digital landscape, where cyber threats are ever-evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated.
